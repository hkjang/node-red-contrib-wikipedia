node-red-contrib-wikisearch
============================

This is wrapper on the [Wiki OpenSearch API](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php) for node red applications.

#Philosophy 

The [MediaWiki API](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php) is wonderfully permissive and horribly documented. This is a lightweight wrapper. Here user is allowed to configure the parameters based on [Wiki OpenSearch API Doc](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Opensearch) and this wrapper will return results accordingly .

#Under the Hood
`wikisearch.js` makes API requests, accepting parameters to call Wiki OpenSearch API.
